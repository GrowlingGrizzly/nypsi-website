<DocsTemplate title='item worth / value' />

items are often associated with a 'worth'. this comes from an average of what users pay for the item in auctions or offers.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="unvalued" />

when items are first added to nypsi, there is no data on auctions or offers for the item. this can make it difficult to estimate how much the item is worth and how much you can sell it for. in these situations it may be best to ask a **trusted** and experience nypsi player. if the item is new and rare, it's likely that it could be worth a lot.

items may also be unvalued if they have simply never been sold on auction or through offers before. this is rare, but does happen with some incredibly rare items that are just traded between players.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="manipulation" />

you may think that it's easy to manipulate the worth of items since it's based on auctions and offers. and it is pretty easy, but this is incredibly easy to find and remove, and is **very much against the rules**. you will be caught and you will be banned.
