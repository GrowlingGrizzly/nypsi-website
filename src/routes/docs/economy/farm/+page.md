## how do i start a farm

to get a farm you need seeds. once you have seeds, you can plant them with `$use`

## how do i get a seed

seeds can be obtained like any other 'rare' item, from crates and scratch cards. different crates / scratch cards will have different odds for giving seeds.

you can see the odds for crates on the [crates page](/docs/economy/items/crates)

the current seeds can be found on the [items page](/item/dave)

## what are they for

with seeds you can grow plants, which you can then harvest for items you can make money from or craft things with.
